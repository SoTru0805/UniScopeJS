FIT2102,Programming paradigms,Undergraduate,6,"<p>Ability to code in differently constructed programming languages is analogous to speaking in different natural languages with varying grammars. Similar to natural languages, programming languages from different paradigms (styles) vary in their expressiveness and efficiency. One programming language may require many screens-full of complex code to accomplish a task for which another requires but a few expressive lines of code. Therefore, understanding the design principles of programming languages enables computational problems to be implemented in dramatically different and powerful ways; leading, in some cases, to solutions that are more elegant, correct, maintainable, efficient and/or extensible.</p>
<p>This unit examines a selection of programming languages and paradigms and explores the evolution of language design from low-level paradigms that are closer to the execution model of the machine, to more high-level declarative paradigms that allow programmers to model a problem precisely rather than specify its solution. The unit covers paradigms such as functional and declarative programming styles, comparing and contrasting them to programming styles that you are already familiar with, including object-oriented, imperative and procedural programming paradigms. We compare type systems supported by various languages, from scripting languages like JavaScript with weak type systems, to gradual typing as in TypeScript, to advanced compiled languages with strong type correctness, such as Haskell. We see these applied to data-modeling techniques (covering polymorphism, mutability-versus-purity, state management, and side-effects) and different models of execution such as strict-versus-lazy evaluation.</p>
<p>The unit provides practical experience with using modern functional programming techniques, non-procedural, non-object-oriented programming languages and discusses the influence of programming language theory on the design of current main-stream computer languages, and how the theory translates to practice. A focus of the unit is that these techniques are applicable and ubiquitous in a variety of modern languages, for example, we will see how functional programming techniques are used in relatively conventional imperative languages like JavaScript, and compare and contrast this with pure functional languages, such as Haskell.</p>"

FIT4444,Honours thesis final,Undergraduate,6,"<p>This unit is a research unit and a requirement for the FIT Honours degrees. Due to the nature of IT, a wide range of Honours project types can be offered to students. Some project components are of a practical nature and may involve some software development and/or experimentation, while other components are of a more theoretical nature.</p>

FIT4701,Final year software engineering project A,Undergraduate,6,<p>The aim of this capstone unit is to provide an opportunity for you to undertake a substantial individual or small group project. Projects undertaken will integrate and build on content from earlier stages of the course. This unit is the first part of a two-unit project.</p>
FIT4702,Final year software engineering project B,Undergraduate,6,<p>This unit is a continuation of FIT4701 Final year software engineering project A. The aim of this capstone unit is to provide an opportunity for you to undertake a substantial individual or small group project. Projects undertaken will integrate and build on content from earlier stages of the course.</p>
MAT1830,Discrete mathematics for computer science,Undergraduate,6,"<p>This unit introduces fundamental discrete mathematics topics including combinatorics, sets, relations and functions; methods of logic and proof, especially proof by induction; probability theory, Bayes' theorem; recursion; recurrence relations; trees and other graphs. It establishes the mathematical basis required for studies in Computer Science and Software Engineering.</p>"
MAT1841,Continuous mathematics for computer science,Undergraduate,6,"<p>The unit covers linear algebra (vectors, equations of lines and planes, solutions of simultaneous equations, determinates, Gauss elimination, Gauss-Jordan method), calculus topics (differentiation, parametric differentiation, fundamental theorem of calculus, and numerical integration), an introduction to multivariable calculus (functions of several variables, partial derivatives, tangent planes and directional derivatives), and the construction of splines and Taylor series expansions are also covered.</p>"
